Explain the output in all tabs. 

counts for what? -- counts of samples

what is class 0 and class 1 for binary classification? -- explain

when discussing train_test_split, indicate that there is already a test set. 

W^1 connects --- 

W^2 connects ---

W^3 connects --- 

784, 200, 100 ,1 -- 

dont say this expression, this result so on.. 

np.dot, * can be changed using np.matmul

this is the expression  --

x,y,zs,activations -- already discussed -- 

m is calculated like this 

error and lo
error and loss function -- not good

i,j,v discussions

shuffling -- how is it done? 

after shuffling, explain the structure of list

patience explanation -- 

do not mix binary and multi-class classification 

Neural_Network -- instantiaton 

loss function -- for train and val

confusion matrix -- explain


---------------------- 

multi-class classification
